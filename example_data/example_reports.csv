Review of MR Images : 

Clinical History :Unknown

report:
There is minimal disc degeneration seen at the lower 3 lumbar levels.
At L3/4 there is a minor diffuse disc bulge without nerve root compression. There is a small additional brado-based far lateral disc hernia which is displacing the left L3 nerve root in the extraforaminal position.
At L4/5 there is a minor disc bulge without clear evidence  of nerve root compression.
At L5/S1 there is hypertrophy of the facet joints narrowing both lateral recesses with compression of both S1 nerve roots. In addition there is a small left paracentral disc extrusion exacerbating the S1 compression on this side.
No evidence of nerve root compression at other lumbar levels.
There is a central hernia seen at T11/1, which is indenting the Conus.

conclusion:
The main abnormality is a small left paracentral disc extrusion and alteral recess stenosis at L5/S1 compressing the leftt S1 root.

PROCEDURE:
MRI of lumbosacral spine without/with IV contrast.
INDICATION:
Radiculopathy post L2-L3 fusion, question incomplete fusion. Persistent symptoms.
COMPARISON:
None.
TECHNIQUE:
Multiplanar and multi-sequence imaging of the lumbosacral spine without/with intravenous contrast
using a 0.3T MRI scanner.
FINDINGS:
Postoperative findings of posterior intrapedicular spinal fusion at L2-L3 noted. The L2-L3 disk is
preserved. Enhancing peridural fibrosis noted at L2-L3 level mildly deforming the thecal sac with
dominant extrinsic impression on the right lateral thecal sac. Non enhancing cystic foci noted
along the posterior elements representing small pseudomeningoceles. Postoperative fusion and
laminectomy noted at L4-L5 level with osseous fusion anteriorly. Osseous hypertrophy of the
posterior elements noted at L4 and L5. Lumbar lordosis is decreased. Multilevel endplate, disk and
facet degenerative changes noted. Conus medullaris terminates at approximately mid L1 vertebral
body level.
L1-L2 shows moderate broad-based disc bulging contributing to mild to moderate left greater than
right neuroforamina narrowing. Spinal canal is grossly patent. Approximately 2 mm L1 on L2
retrolisthesis noted.
L2-L3 shows moderate nonenhancing bi foraminal broad-based disk bulging contributing to mild-tomoderate right greater than left neural foramina narrowing. Moderate acquired spinal canal stenosis
noted due to enhancing peridural fibrosis with asymmetric more focal extrinsic impression on the
right lateral ventral thecal sac. Negligible spondylolisthesis of L2 on L3 noted.
L3-L4 level shows mild disk desiccation and height loss. Extraforaminal focal annular tears noted on
both sides. Spinal canal and foramina are patent.
