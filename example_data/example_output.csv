Review of MR Images : 

Clinical History :Unknown

report:
There is minimal disc degeneration seen at the lower 3 lumbar levels.
At L3/4 there is a minor diffuse disc bulge without nerve root compression. There is a small additional brado-based far lateral disc hernia which is displacing the left L3 nerve root in the extraforaminal position.
At L4/5 there is a minor disc bulge without clear evidence  of nerve root compression.
At L5/S1 there is hypertrophy of the facet joints narrowing both lateral recesses with compression of both S1 nerve roots. In addition there is a small left paracentral disc extrusion exacerbating the S1 compression on this side.
No evidence of nerve root compression at other lumbar levels.
There is a central hernia seen at T11/1, which is indenting the Conus.

conclusion:
The main abnormality is a small left paracentral disc extrusion and alteral recess stenosis at L5/S1 compressing the leftt S1 root.

Based on the provided medical report, the following findings related to stenosis have been identified:

1. Alteral recess stenosis at L5/S1: This refers to narrowing or compression of the lateral recesses (the space where the nerve roots exit the spinal canal) at the level of L5/S1. The report mentions that there is hypertrophy (excessive growth) of the facet joints at this level, causing narrowing of both lateral recesses and resulting in compression of both S1 nerve roots. Additionally, a small left paracentral disc extrusion (a fragment of disc material that has ruptured through the annulus fibrosus and into the spinal canal) is exacerbating the S1 compression on this side.

2. Far lateral disc herniation at L3/4: While this finding does not directly relate to stenosis, it can potentially lead to nerve root compression if the herniated disc material comes into contact with the adjacent nerve root. However, the report notes that there is only minor diffuse disc bulge (swelling of the intervertebral disc) at this level without clear evidence of nerve root compression.

Overall, the most significant finding related to stenosis is the alteral recess stenosis at L5/S1, which is causing compression of the S1 nerve roots. This could result in symptoms such as pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the legs and feet, depending on the severity and location of the compression. Further evaluation and management may be necessary based on the patient's clinical presentation and the extent of the stenosis.",22.296875,3.1328125

PROCEDURE:
MRI of lumbosacral spine without/with IV contrast.
INDICATION:
Radiculopathy post L2-L3 fusion, question incomplete fusion. Persistent symptoms.
COMPARISON:
None.
TECHNIQUE:
Multiplanar and multi-sequence imaging of the lumbosacral spine without/with intravenous contrast
using a 0.3T MRI scanner.
FINDINGS:
Postoperative findings of posterior intrapedicular spinal fusion at L2-L3 noted. The L2-L3 disk is
preserved. Enhancing peridural fibrosis noted at L2-L3 level mildly deforming the thecal sac with
dominant extrinsic impression on the right lateral thecal sac. Non enhancing cystic foci noted
along the posterior elements representing small pseudomeningoceles. Postoperative fusion and
laminectomy noted at L4-L5 level with osseous fusion anteriorly. Osseous hypertrophy of the
posterior elements noted at L4 and L5. Lumbar lordosis is decreased. Multilevel endplate, disk and
facet degenerative changes noted. Conus medullaris terminates at approximately mid L1 vertebral
body level.
L1-L2 shows moderate broad-based disc bulging contributing to mild to moderate left greater than
right neuroforamina narrowing. Spinal canal is grossly patent. Approximately 2 mm L1 on L2
retrolisthesis noted.
L2-L3 shows moderate nonenhancing bi foraminal broad-based disk bulging contributing to mild-tomoderate right greater than left neural foramina narrowing. Moderate acquired spinal canal stenosis
noted due to enhancing peridural fibrosis with asymmetric more focal extrinsic impression on the
right lateral ventral thecal sac. Negligible spondylolisthesis of L2 on L3 noted.
L3-L4 level shows mild disk desiccation and height loss. Extraforaminal focal annular tears noted on
both sides. Spinal canal and foramina are patent.

The MRI report reveals evidence of stenosis at the L2-L3 level. There is moderate bi-pedicular disk bulging leading to mild to moderate neuroforaminal narrowing on both the left and right sides. Additionally, there is moderate acquired spinal canal stenosis caused by enhancing peridural fibrosis resulting in an asymmetrical, more focal extrinsic impression on the right lateral aspect of the thecal sac. This finding suggests that the narrowing of the spinal canal and compression of the nerves may be causing symptoms such as radiculopathy, which could explain the patient's persistent symptoms following their L2-L3 fusion procedure. It should be noted that the conus medullaris ends at approximately mid L1 vertebral body level, indicating normal anatomy in this area. Overall, these findings suggest the presence of stenosis at the L2-L3 level.",23.1875,3.39453125
